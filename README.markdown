# Solarwindy

Solarwindy is an arduino based weather station. He reads wind and temperature and shoots it up to Sky Bob (he's in the cloud. or he's a cloud. whatever.) Solarwindy lives near Lake Meritt, Oakland in the great state of California. Someday Solarwindy will grow a gprs shield and attached to a solar panel will roam free.

# Sky Bob

[Our friend in the sky.](http://skybob.meteor.com/ "Sky Bob lives here.") Sky Bob is omnipotent, mostly benevolent but sometimes downright nasty. In any case, he'll tell you exactly what's up. His best friend is [meteor](http://meteor.com/ "Meteor JS").
