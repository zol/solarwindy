# Description

The solarwindy is an arduino based Autonomous Weather Station. It uploads weather data to a webserver using a GSM quad band chip and is solar powered for totally autonomous remote deployment. It is ideal for sports such as paragliding and kiteboarding that benefit from localized near real time weather info. Here you will find step by step instructions on how to make it, where to buy the components and the software to run it.

# Project Goals

* Price: As low as possible.
* Repeatability: No exotic components, everything must be readily available online and internationally shipped.
* Complete DIY instructions: Complete step-by-step instructions and parts list so that someone with minimal technical experience and tools can build the solarwindy.
* Robustness: Given the price constraint, maintain a level of hardware and software robustness that will ensure the solarwindy survives outdoors and is easy to debug given any issues.
* Community: The project is totally open source, anyone can contribute improvements, fixes and documentation.

# Instructions
